# Chroma key technique

This project implements a chroma key technique, which is commonly used to replace a specific background color, such as green or blue, in images or videos. The process involves detecting the background color using a mask created in the HSV color space and then replacing that color with a new background. This is achieved through both automated and manual methods: one approach utilizes libraries like OpenCV for efficient processing of individual frames or video sequences, while the other manually handles pixel data to achieve the same effect. This flexibility allows the chroma keying process to be customized for different use cases, showcasing how the technique can be applied in a variety of scenarios.
